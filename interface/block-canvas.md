# Block Canvas

It's easy to forget, but the actual contents of your block, or the “canvas” (as we call it), is as much a place for controls as any other area of the UI.

Typically, the canvas area will primary be for entering text, but it's capable of much more. Ultimately, you can display any React component (and thus HTML content) inside the canvas, making it as flexible and powerful as the rest of the interface.
