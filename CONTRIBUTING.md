# Contributing

This documentation is open source, and as such we strongly invite contributions to expand and improve what we have.

For editing the files, we recommend [Typora](https://typora.io). Typora provides a great experience for editing Markdown, especially in a primarily-Markdown repo environment. It can also handle bundling images into the repo and linking them as appropriate.
